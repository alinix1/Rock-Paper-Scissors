## [Deploy Link](https://alinix1.github.io/Rock-Paper-Scissors/)

## Project Overview
Rock, Paper, Scissors is a web application that allows users to play the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors virtually against a computer.  The classic game has the following rules:  **rock** crushes **scissors** >> **scissors** cuts **paper** >> **paper** covers **rock**. The difficult option includes **lizard** and **spock** for additional challenges and strategies.  

## Functionality
- A user can choose which game:  classic or difficult
- When a user selects either game they are taken to a new page with the fighter options
- When a user selects which fighter the game will begin against the computer and the new page will show the human or user's choice and the randomized computer choice
- The outcome is either the human wins, computer wins, or it is a draw
- The score is updated after each game in the upper left and upper right sections of the page
- When a user wants to play a different game, a change game button will appear on the upper left side of the page
- the user will then return to the main page and can play again

## Reflection
In the beginning I made an outline or architecture for the data model (classes) that helped guide me in building the Player class and the Game class.  I struggled with the CSS the most on this project.  I most likely will not add additional features/functionality.  If I do decide to add a feature I would like to add a reset button.
